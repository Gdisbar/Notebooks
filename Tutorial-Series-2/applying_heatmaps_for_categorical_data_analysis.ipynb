        "# Medical appointment no-shows analysis\n",
        "This analysis is part of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program and aims to explore a dataset containing aproximately 100k medical appointments from the Brazilian public health system. It is basically divided into four sections: (1) *Introduction*, where the investigation problem is set and the dataset is described; (2) *Data Wrangling*, where the acquired data are cleaned and parsed; (3) *Exploratory Data Analysis*, in which some intuition about the data are built based on the found patterns; (4) *Conclusion*, where the found insights about the problem are reviewed and communicated. Although the main techniques involved in data analysis are applied, we highlight the use of heatmaps to gain insights regarding the study topic.\n",
