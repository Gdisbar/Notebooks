This survey received 23,859 usable respondents from 147 countries and territories. The median time in the survey was around 17 minutes.\n\n---\n\n**Top five countries in 2017:**\n1. USA - 4197 participants\n2. India - 2704 participants\n3. Russia - 578 participants\n4. United Kingdom - 535  participants\n5. China - 471 participants\n\n**Top five countries in 2018:**\n1. USA - 4716 participants\n2. India - 4417 participants\n3. China - 1644 participants\n4. Russia - 879 participants\n5. Brazil - 736 participants\n\n---\n\n**Age Distribution in 2017 (left) vs 2018 (right):**\n\n* 18-21:** 7.2% - 12.7%**\n* 22-24:** 14.9% - 21.5%**\n* 25-29: **25.9% - 25.8%**\n* 30-34: **18.5% - 15.8%**\n* 35-39: **12.6% - 9.4%**\n* 40-44: **7.7% - 5.7%**\n* 44+: **12.9% - 8.4%**\n\n**% of 30+** people in **2017 is 51.7%** but **39.3% in 2018**. It is a very tremendous decline. Did 30+ people lost their interest or find other platforms we do not know?\n\n---\n\nThere are much more men **(81% vs. 17%)** as in 2017 but hopefully, the gap is narrowing in the following years since many women are entering the field.\n\nThe more female start to code actively **(<1 year)** compared to male starters. **(27% vs 24%)**\n\nMost related to active coding, the more female start to use ML methods at work or in school **(<1 year)** compared to male starters. **(36% vs 33%)**\n\n% of the master degree of female and male is **52.9%** and **46.4%** respectively.\n\n% of the bachelor's degree of female and male is **25.7%** and **32.1%** respectively.\n\n\n---\n\nComputer science, non-cs engineering, mathematics & statistics, and business disciplines are the leading majors. \n\n% of male in computers/technology industry is higher than % of female. **(26% vs 23%)**\n\n% of female in academics/education industry is higher than % of male. **(14% vs 12%)**\n\nComputers/technology is the leading industry for all majors. Second is the academics/education industry except for business disciplines where **accounting/finance is in the 2nd place.**\n\n---\n\nPython is the most used programs regardless of gender and majors. On the other hand, % of female use R and SQL is higher than male. % of R and SQL is high for those who have major in Math & Stats and Business disciplines.\n\nIn 2018, there is nothing worth to debate about which programming language (Python vs R). **Learn Python (75%) ** and be part of the data science world!\n\n---\n\n\nResponses of female and male to **\"Are you a data scientist?\"** question are very similar and most of them consider themselves as a data scientist.\n\nResponses of people who have different majors are very similar except many math & stats people who are very confident and say \"definitely yes\" probably results below.\n\nActive coding in years is similar for all majors except people who major in math & stats. There are more experienced respondents. **(3+ years)**\n\nYears spent in ML methods are similar for all majors except people who major in math & stats. There are more experienced respondents. **(>1 years)**\n\n---\n\nTop online platforms female and male spent the most amount of time are more or less same: Coursera with **38%** for both genders. As an exception female spend more time on Data Camp **(11% vs 15%)** while male spend more time on Kaggle Learn. **(5% vs 7%)**\n\nCoursera is again leader online platform for all majors. Secondly, CS and non-CS Engineers prefer Udemy while math & stats and business disciplines block prefer DataCamp.\n\n---\n\n\nMale and female respondents interact with numerical data mostly. On the other hand, male respondents interact with image and tabular data most compared to female respondents.\n\nRespondents who in all majors interact with numerical data mostly **except computer engineers who interact with text data more often.**\n\n---\n\n\n**Almost 90%** of male and female respondents think that independent projects are at least important as academic achievements.\n\n---\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import
